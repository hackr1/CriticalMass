Critical Mass
=============

"Critical Mass" is a computer game
currently developed by Alexander Seitz


"Critical Mass" will be a mix of a classical
2d RPG (like the early Pok√©mon or Final
Fantasy games), and Puzzle Game.
It is currently being developed as a
Single Player game, but both a cooperative
and a competitive multiplayer mode will
be added as soon as the singleplayer game
is completed. Critical Mass will be 
available for Micrososft Windows, Linux
and Mac OS X. It is programmed in Java
using Swing.

This project is open source. (See 
http://www.opensource.org for more 
information about open source. It is
being developed for fun and the authors
do not intend to use it for any com-
mercial purpose. The game is licensed
under the Eclipse Public License (EPL),
version 1.0, as published on this 
web page:

I am currently looking for talented
people who would like to voluntarily
participate in this project. If you
are a programmer, graphics designer,
voice actor, or sound designer, and if
you are OK with the fact that this 
is a hobby and I can't pay you for
your help, please contact me via e-mail
(alex.seitz1@gmx.net). I am sure you'll
have a great time making a game with me!
